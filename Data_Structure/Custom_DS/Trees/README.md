# Tree

-- A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

-- A tree is a non-linear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.

-- In linear data structures, the time required to search is proportional to the size of the data set.

-- Trees however, owing to the non linear nature allow quicker and easier access to the data.

-- A tree will not contain any loops or cycles.

## Tree Usage

-- Where heirarichal data structures are required

-- Example: File systems for direcory structure

-- A family tree
-- An organisation tree
-- DOM
-- Chat bots
-- Abstract Syntax tree

## Terminology

-- Parent and child nodes : A node is an immediate predecessor of any node is parent and immediate successor of any node is child node.

-- Root Node : The node from where tree originates and does not have any parent.

## Leaf Nodes

-- Which do not have any child node.

## Siblings

-- Nodes with same parent

## Ancestor nodes

-- Parents parent

## Path

-- Sequence of nodes and edges from one node to another.

## Distance

-- Numbers of edges along the shortest path between two nodes.

# Properties specific to node

-- Degree of a node is the total no. of child node it has.

-- Depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that node.

-- The depth of root node is always zero.

## Height of a node.

-- It is the number of edges fromt the deepest leaf to that node.

-- Height of the root node is considered as the height of the tree.
